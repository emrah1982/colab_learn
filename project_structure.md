# Project Structure and Organization

This document outlines the reorganization of the YOLO11 training script into a modular, well-structured project.

## Directory Structure

## Component Responsibilities

### main.py
- Entry point for the application
- Interactive setup functionality
- Orchestrates the entire training workflow

### setup_utils.py
- GPU detection and device management
- Package installation
- Environment checking
- Directory setup
- Google Drive mounting (for Colab)

### hyperparameters.py
- Creating default hyperparameter files
- Loading and managing hyperparameters
- Customizing hyperparameters based on dataset/model

### dataset_utils.py
- Downloading datasets from Roboflow
- Fixing directory structure for YOLO11 compatibility
- Updating dataset YAML configuration
- Dataset analysis and integrity checking

### memory_utils.py
- Memory usage monitoring
- Periodic memory cleanup during training
- Memory optimization utilities
- System information reporting

### training.py
- Model training functionality
- Periodic model saving
- Model validation
- Model export to different formats
- Saving results to Google Drive

### config.py
- Configuration management
- Loading/saving configuration
- Creating configuration templates
- Converting between configuration formats

## How the Components Work Together

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - `main.py` calls functions from `setup_utils.py` to prepare the environment
   - `hyperparameters.py` creates and loads hyperparameter configuration

2. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - `dataset_utils.py` handles downloading and organizing the dataset
   - Directory structure is fixed to match YOLO11 expectations

3. **Training Configuration**:
   - User inputs are collected through interactive setup or configuration files
   - `config.py` handles loading and processing configuration

4. **Training Phase**:
   - `training.py` performs the actual model training
   - `memory_utils.py` monitors and manages memory during training
   - Models are periodically saved and eventually exported

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a clear responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to update specific components
3. **Reusability**: Components can be used independently
4. **Readability**: Code is organized in logical units
5. **Scalability**: New features can be added without disrupting existing functionality

## How to Extend the Framework

### Adding New Features

1. Identify which component should contain the new feature
2. Implement the feature in the appropriate file
3. Export the feature through `__init__.py` if needed
4. Update usage examples and documentation

### Adding New Model Types

1. Extend `hyperparameters.py` to include parameters for the new model
2. Update model selection in `interactive_setup()` function
3. Add support in `training.py` if needed

### Adding New Export Formats

1. Extend the `export_model()` function in `training.py`
2. Add support for mapping the format to file extensions
3. Update documentation

## Conclusion

This reorganization creates a more maintainable, readable, and extensible codebase while preserving all the functionality of the original script. Each component has a clear responsibility, making the code easier to understand, modify, and use in different contexts.
